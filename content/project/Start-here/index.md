When I first started working as a transitional nurse practitioner  in an emergency department I felt a bit lost and didnt know where to start. The department I worked in didnt have nurse practitioners, nor had I worked with a nurse practitioner before. After attempting to seek some support from other local ED NP's  I was met with resistance and received minimal support on what a NP role should be or look like. I decided to contact various emergency departments in different states to gain some understanding of what the role is, the skills required and types of presentations they managed.

To my surprise of the 10+ EDs there was only 1 site that had an established circulum / pathway for NPs. The NP was lovely enough to share an outline of what she and her colleagues had established to give me a head start in my NP journey - for which I was truly grateful.

This project aims to help fellow TNP/NPC/SNP out there who are in a similar position and want to set up an NP role in their local area.
