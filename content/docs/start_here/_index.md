## Developer

This handbook was put together by Jason Carney. I gathered and adapted information from different clinical resources to help nurse practitioner students with their education and training.


## Disclaimer 

This handbook doesn't replace medical textbooks, but it's a helpful guide to support NP students. It's important for NP students to always refer to different medical texts, resources, and clinical support teams to expand their knowledge. Remember to use good clinical judgment and practice safety when providing patient care care.
